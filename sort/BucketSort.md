# Sort Algorithm: Bucket Sort

## Overview


## Algorithm Classification
The following table contains information about the analysis of the Bucket Sort algorithm. It defines the worst, average and best cases in terms of time complexity and also the worst case in space complexity.

| Classification | Value|
| --- | --- |
| Class | Sorting Algorithm |
| Data Structure | Array |
| Time Complexity: Worst | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
| Time Complexity: Average | O(n+k) |
| TimeComplexity: Best | O(n+k) |
| Space Complexity: Worst | O(n) |

## Bucket Sort In Java
The Bucket Sort class implements the Bucket Sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers.

```java
```
