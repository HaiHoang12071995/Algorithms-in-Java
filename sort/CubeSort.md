# Sort Algorithm: Cube Sort

## Overview


## Algorithm Classification
The following table contains information about the analysis of the Cube Sort algorithm. It defines the worst, average and best cases in terms of time complexity and also the worst case in space complexity.

| Classification | Value|
| --- | --- |
| Class | Sorting Algorithm |
| Data Structure | Array |
| Time Complexity: Worst |  |
| Time Complexity: Average |  |
| TimeComplexity: Best |  |
| Space Complexity: Worst | |

## Pseudocode
The following is the pseudocode for the Cube Sort algorithm.
```

```

## Cube Sort In Java
The Cube Sort class implements the Cube Sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers.

```java
```
