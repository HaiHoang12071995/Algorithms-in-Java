# Sort Algorithm: Shell Sort

## Overview


## Algorithm Classification
The following table contains information about the analysis of the Shell Sort algorithm. It defines the worst, average and best cases in terms of time complexity and also the worst case in space complexity.

| Classification | Value|
| --- | --- |
| Class | Sorting Algorithm |
| Data Structure | Array |
| Time Complexity: Best | Ω(n log(n)) |
| Time Complexity: Average | Θ(n log<sup>2</sup>n) |
| Time Complexity: Worst | O(n<sup>2</sup>) |
| Space Complexity: Worst | O(1) |

## Shell Sort In Java
The Shell Sort class implements the Shell Sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers.

```java
```
