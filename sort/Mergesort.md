# Sort Algorithm: Mergesort

## Overview


## Algorithm Classification
The following table contains information about the analysis of the Mergesort algorithm. It defines the worst, average and best cases in terms of time complexity and also the worst case in space complexity.

| Classification | Value|
| --- | --- |
| Class | Sorting Algorithm |
| Data Structure | Array |
| Time Complexity: Worst |  |
| Time Complexity: Average |  |
| TimeComplexity: Best |  |
| Space Complexity: Worst | |
