# Sort Algorithm: Counting Sort

## Overview


## Algorithm Classification
The following table contains information about the analysis of the Counting Sort algorithm. It defines the worst, average and best cases in terms of time complexity and also the worst case in space complexity.

| Classification | Value|
| --- | --- |
| Class | Sorting Algorithm |
| Data Structure | Array |
| Time Complexity: Best | Ω(n+k) |
| Time Complexity: Average | Θ(n+k) |
| Time Complexity: Worst | O(n+k) |
| Space Complexity: Worst | O(k) |

Please use the following [link][0] for an explanation on Big-O notation and what is good, fair and bad.

## Pseudocode
The following is the pseudocode for the Counting Sort algorithm.
```

```

## Counting Sort In Java
The Counting Sort class implements the Counting Sort algorithm for sorting an array of integers.

```java
```
