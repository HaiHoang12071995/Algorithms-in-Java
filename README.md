# Algorithms in Java
## About This Repository
Algorithms existed long before computers existed. An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem solving operations, especially by a computer. So it makes sense that ever since we got computers, there are now much more algorithms. Algorithms is at the heart of computing.

This repository contains a number of the well known algorithms implemented in the Java programming language.
